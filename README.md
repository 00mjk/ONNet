# ONNet

**ONNet** is an open-source Python/C++ package for the optical neural networks, which includes the following types of networks:

- #### Diffractive deep network

- #### Diffractive network with multiple binary output plane

Optical neural network(ONN) is a novel machine learning framework on the physical principles of optics, which is still in its infancy and shows great potential. ONN tries to find optimal modulation parameters to change the phase, amplitude or other physical variable of optical wave propagation. So in the final output plane, the optical distribution has special pattern which is the indicator of objectâ€™s class or value. ONN opens new doors for the machine learning.
